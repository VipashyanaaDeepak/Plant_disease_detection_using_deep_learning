INTRODUCTION
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of plant disease detection by enabling accurate and efficient identification of diseases in crops. The use of advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, coupled with transfer learning and robust evaluation techniques, has significantly enhanced model performance.

Key Components
2.1 Advanced CNN Architectures
Recent CNN architectures have made significant contributions to plant disease detection tasks:

ResNet (He et al., 2016): Introduced skip connections to address the vanishing gradient problem, enabling deeper networks without loss of learning ability.
DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017): Utilized dense connections between layers, improving information flow and parameter efficiency.
EfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2019): Optimized network scaling, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced computational costs.
These architectures excel in capturing fine-grained features and perform well across diverse datasets, especially when used with transfer learning techniques.

2.2 Stratified k-Fold Cross-Validation
One of the main challenges in plant disease detection is class imbalance, where certain diseases are overrepresented in the dataset. To address this, stratified k-fold cross-validation ensures proportional representation of each class in every fold.

This technique improves model reliability and generalization ability (Zhang et al., 2019), particularly in datasets with high class imbalance.
2.3 Leveraging Pre-trained Models with the timm Library
The timm (PyTorch Image Models) library provides a range of high-performance architectures optimized for image classification. Pre-trained models available in this library, such as those trained on ImageNet, have several advantages:

Faster convergence during training.
Improved accuracy when fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets.
Reduced dependency on large, labeled datasets.
This approach is particularly beneficial in agricultural applications, where labeled data is often limited.

2.4 Comparative Studies in Plant Disease Detection
Comparative analysis of CNN architectures highlights the relative strengths and weaknesses of different models:

Ferentinos (2018): Found ResNet and Inception models to perform best on complex, multi-class plant disease datasets.
Studies using Kaggle datasets revealed that model selection significantly impacts detection performance, with some architectures being better suited for nuanced differences between diseases.
